# home-value-analysis
Our goal is provide insight to real estate agencies that help people in the housing market. Specifically, we are seeking to determine factors that make a significant impact on price. To draw these conclusions, we used data from about 21,000 King County homes and their characteristics such as bathrooms/Bedrooms, square feet, condition, grade, floors, location (latitude/Longitude/Waterfront), and year built.

There were quite a few key takeaways from our model. One of the important ones is that location matters. Homes with a waterfront and a high view rating tend to be more valuable. Condition is also an important one, as homes with the highest condition rating were valued much higher than homes from the rest of the sample. This is a point of emphasis because condition can be controlled by homeowners. Another takeaway is that older homes in our sample had more value. While the year of construction did not make a massive difference, it was statistically significant and therefore worth including in our model.
